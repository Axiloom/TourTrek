TourTrek is an android application developer for those who love to explore new places. In this application, a user can create their own personal account where they can keep track of excursions they decide to embark on. Users can create a Tour, which includes a location, date, and name. Tours consist of attractions a user would like to attend, which can range anywhere from restaurants to amusement parks. Each attraction can store its name, location, cost, and date to keep track of what time/date you want to attend each attraction with reminders included. TourTrek also features a public tour market where you can explore tours that other users have completed and embark on these excursions yourself.
